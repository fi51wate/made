# Project Plan

## Comparison of life expectancy in the countries of the Americas

Awesome MADE project.

## Main Question

1. How has life expectancy developed over the last 50 years in the various countries of North and South America?
2. are there clear differences to the growth of the economy?

## Description

This project aims to answer two questions. 
Firstly, it analyses how life expectancy has developed in the countries of North and South America over the last 20 years. 
All possible countries from North and South America will be analysed and their life expectancy over the last 50 years will be determined. The next step is to determine what influence economic growth has on this. In order to be able to answer this question better, the data from as many countries as possible must be collected and analysed. 

The results of this project will provide a better understanding of how social and economic conditions affect life expectancy in North and South America and whether economic prosperity automatically leads to a longer life.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Life Expectancy Data
* Data URL: https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3a68
* Data Type: CSV

The 2024 Revision of World Population Prospects represents the latest global set of demographic estimates and projections prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat. It displays key demographic indicators for selected periods or dates from 1950 to 2100, for the world, development groups, regions, subregions, and countries or areas with more than 1,000 inhabitants in 2023. For countries or areas with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants in 2023, only figures related to population size and growth are provided. The estimates and projections contained in this revision cover a 150-year time horizon, which can be subdivided into estimates (1950-2023) and projections (2024-2100).
