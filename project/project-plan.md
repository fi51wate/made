# Project Plan

## Comparison of life expectancy in the countries of the Americas

Awesome MADE project.

## Main Question

1. How has life expectancy developed over the last 50 years in the various countries of North and South America?
2. are there clear differences to the growth of the economy (Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita)?

## Description

This project aims to answer two questions. 
Firstly, it analyses how life expectancy has developed in the countries of North and South America over the last 20 years. 
All possible countries from North and South America will be analysed and their life expectancy over the last 50 years will be determined. The next step is to determine what influence economic growth has on this. In order to be able to answer this question better, the data from as many countries as possible must be collected and analysed. 

The results of this project will provide a better understanding of how social and economic conditions affect life expectancy in North and South America and whether economic prosperity automatically leads to a longer life.
